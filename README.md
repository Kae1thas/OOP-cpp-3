# Labwork 3

Objective of the work: to study the principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) inheritance. Implement the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.

Task:
It is required to create a template for a certain target class A. Each variant specifies implementation requirements by indicating the use of a certain server class B. This means that an object of class B is used as an element of class A. The server class can be either a class created by the programmer as part of the same task or a class from the standard library.If a dynamic array is specified instead of a server class, this means that an array allocated using the new operation is used to store elements in the target class. In all variants, it is necessary to provide for the generation and handling of exceptions for possible error situations. In all variants, demonstrate in the main client the usage of the created class, including situations leading to exception generation. Show instantiation of the template for types int, double, and std::string.

During this laboratory work, I studied fundamental concepts (classes, subclasses, and methods) and learned to implement the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.
